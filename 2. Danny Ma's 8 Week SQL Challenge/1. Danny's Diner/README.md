# 2. Rank ALL The Things
Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.

A 	2021-01-01 	curry 	15 	N 	null
